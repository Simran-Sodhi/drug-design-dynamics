Introduction to our R shiny app:

1. two Protein-Ligand Interaction simulation methods were provided in our app: Monte Carlo and Machine Learning:
  a. Monte Carlo:
      Tha app takes one protein file (.pdb/.mol2) and multiple ligand files (.mol2 files uploaded together in a directory) as input,
      after successfully uploaded the data, hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get:
      (1) the plot of all protein-ligand pairs' binding energies,
      (2) the structure of protein-ligand pair with minimum binding energy shown (need to preprocess the output protein and ligand file (.mol2) using Chimera or PyMOL to generate the video and save as ./output/results.mp4).
   
      Example dataset stored in folder ./MCdata.
      
  b. Machine Learning:
      The app takes protein-ligand interaction dataset (.csv file) as input,
      you can then select features you are interested in from ["electrostatic", "polar_solvation", "non_polar_solvation", "vdW"], and select models you would like
      to use from ["RandomForest", "DecisionTree", "XGBoost", "LightGBM", "SVM"],
      after successfully uploaded the data and selected the parameters, hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get:
      (1) the evalution matrix of all models (evalution method includes: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, MAPE),
      (2) feature importance tables generated by models you selected.
      
      Example dataset stored in folder ./MLdata.

2. NOTICE:
  a. All other external data should be put under folder either ./MCdata or ./MLdata (like the example).
  b. remember to set your Python path at Line 241 in app.R to ensure that the ML python script can be executed.
