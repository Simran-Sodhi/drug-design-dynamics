# R shiny

Interactive web app for predicting protein-ligand interations by evaluating their binding energies using Monte Carlo and machine learning simulations method.

## Requirements

- Set your Python path at Line 241 in app.R to ensure that the ML python script can be executed.
- Put all external data under folder either ./MCdata or ./MLdata for data to be accessible (like the example data).

## Usage

a. Monte Carlo:<br />
- Tha app takes one protein file (.pdb/.mol2) and multiple ligand files (.mol2 files uploaded together in a directory) as input,<br />
- after successfully uploaded the data, hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get:<br />
  (1) the plot of all protein-ligand pairs' binding energies,<br />
  (2) the structure of protein-ligand pair with minimum binding energy shown<br />
  (need to preprocess the output protein and ligand file (.mol2) using Chimera or PyMOL to generate the video and save as ./output/results.mp4).<br />
   <br />
      
b. Machine Learning:<br />
- The app takes protein-ligand interaction dataset (.csv file) as input,<br />
- you can then select features you are interested in from ["electrostatic", "polar_solvation", "non_polar_solvation", "vdW"], 
  and select models you would like to use from ["RandomForest", "DecisionTree", "XGBoost", "LightGBM", "SVM"],<br />
- after successfully uploaded the data and selected the parameters, hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get:<br />
  (1) the evalution matrix of all models (evalution method includes: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, MAPE),<br />
  (2) feature importance tables generated by models you selected.<br />
