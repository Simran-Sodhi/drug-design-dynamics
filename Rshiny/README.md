Introduction to our R shiny app:

1. two PLI simulation methods were provided: Monte Carlo and Machine Learning:
  a. Monte Carlo:
      Input one protein file (.pdb/.mol2) and multiple ligand files (.mol2 files uploaded in a directory);
      hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get the plot of all pairs' binding energy,
      the structure of protein-ligand pair with minimum binding energy will also be shown as video, but you need to preprocess it using Chimera or PyMOL.
      Example dataset stored in folder ./MCdata.
      
  b. Machine Learning:
      Input protein-ligand interaction dataset as a .csv file;
      select features you are interested in from ["electrostatic", "polar_solvation", "non_polar_solvation", "vdW"];
      select models you would like to use from ["RandomForest", "DecisionTree", "XGBoost", "LightGBM", "SVM"];
      hit "Run Simulation" button, and you will get the evalution matrix and feature importance tables generated by all models.
      Example dataset stored in folder ./MLdata.

2. NOTICE:
  a. All other external data should be put under folder either ./MCdata or ./MLdata (like the example).
  b. remember to set your Python file at Line 241 to ensure that the ML python script can be executed.
